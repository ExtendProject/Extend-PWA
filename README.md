Here's a revised and more professional README for your project, **Extend**:

# Extend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd extend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js modules using either `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

After the server has started, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### 5. Edit Your Project

You can begin editing the project by modifying the `pages/index.js` file. The application will automatically update to reflect your changes.
